### Social Categorizations in CRAN Data

*Simon P. Couch*

The Comprehensive R Archive Network now hosts over 15,000 R packages, many of 
which provide datasets supplying demographic information on people. How do the 
choices that R users make in constructing datasets reflect their understandings
of social categories? Are these decisions patterned by discipline? Rather than 
viewing datasets as “raw” or unargumentative, I argue that the way we name 
columns, write descriptions of these columns in codebooks, construct categories
within which subjects must identify (or be assigned), and assign numerical 
(and by extension, ordinal) values to categories is a process of argumentation. 
Using CRAN data, I attempt to characterize how sex, gender, race, and ethnicity 
are conceptualized by this influential portion of the R community, and draw 
from intersectional feminist literature to reflect on best practices for 
encoding social divisions more thoughtfully.

This project began as a term paper for SOC 326 (Science and Social Difference) 
at Reed College in Fall 2019, taught by Dr. Kjersten Whittington.
